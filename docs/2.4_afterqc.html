Great! You are using Git for version control. Tracking code development and connecting the code version to the results is critical for reproducibility. The version displayed above was the version of the Git repository at the time these results were generated. <br><br> Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results (you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or <code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results were generated:

<p>In the above scatterplot, we show the proportion of hets vs the average intensity for the X chromosome SNPs. In calculating the proportion of heterozygous genotypes for the individuals, we look at X chromosome genotypes equal to 2 which corresponds to the heterozygote) relative to not being 0 (which is used to encode missing genotypes). The genotypes are arranged with rows being individuals and columns being markers.</p>
<p>The following are the mice that have had sex incorrectly assigned:</p>

<p>For the markers with lots of missing genotypes, it’s not necessarily the case that the remaining genotypes are full of errors, but in studying the allele intensities at these SNPs, it does appear that for the bulk of such markers, the genotypes are not being called appropriately.</p>

<p>The bulk of the markers seem well behaved, but there are a number of markers with unusual genotype frequencies. There are markers that show no homozygotes for the major allele. (These sit on the left edge.) There are markers that are monomorphic (100% AA genotypes; lower-right vertex). And there some markers with some of each homozygote but no heterozygotes (bottom edge). Further, there are a bunch of markers where the minor allele appears to be private to one founder strain (upper-left panel) but show a high frequency of minor alleles in the DO offspring.</p>

the presentation more consistent at the cost of the webpage sometimes
taking slightly longer to load. Note that this only works because the
